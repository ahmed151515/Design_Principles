# Tight vs. Loose Coupling in C# 

This note explores the concepts of Tight and Loose Coupling using a C# notification service example.

## Tight Coupling

### Definition
    Tight coupling means components have strong dependencies on each other's concrete implementations. Changes in one component often necessitate changes in others.

### Example: `NotificationService`

This `NotificationService` demonstrates tight coupling. It directly depends on concrete classes (`EmailService`, `SmsService`).

```csharp
namespace _3_TightlyVsLooselyCoupled_Tight
{
    // Concrete implementations 
    // (Assume EmailService and SmsService classes exist as defined later)

    /// <summary>
    /// This is an example of Tight Coupling.
    /// - The `NotificationService` class has direct dependencies on concrete services (`EmailService`, `SmsService`).
    /// - It knows all the details of these instances, making changes, maintenance, and scaling harder.
    /// </summary>
    class NotificationService
    {
        private readonly EmailService _emailService;
        private readonly SmsService _smsService;

        // Constructor directly requires concrete types
        public NotificationService(EmailService emailService, SmsService smsService)
        {
            _emailService = emailService;
            _smsService = smsService;
        }

        public void Notify()
        {
            _emailService.Send(); // Directly calls concrete implementation
            _smsService.Send();   // Directly calls concrete implementation
        }
    }

    // Example Usage within Main:
    /*
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Example of Tight Coupling
        NotificationService notification = new NotificationService(
            new EmailService(), // Instantiating concrete types directly
            new SmsService()
        );
        notification.Notify(); 
    }
    */
}

```
### Pros & Cons of Tight Coupling

#### Pros
    ✅ Faster initial development and launch.
    ✅ Simpler design with fewer abstractions (initially).

#### Cons
    ❌ Difficult to maintain, test, or extend. Adding a new notification type (e.g., Push Notification) requires modifying `NotificationService`.
    ❌ Changes in one part of the system (e.g., `EmailService` constructor changes) can significantly impact dependent parts (`NotificationService` instantiation).
    ❌ Harder to unit test `NotificationService` in isolation, as it requires real `EmailService` and `SmsService` instances or complex mocking setups.

## Loose Coupling

### Definition
    Loose coupling means components depend on abstractions (like interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations. This reduces inter-dependencies, making the system more modular, flexible, and maintainable.

### Example: `NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling`

This version uses an interface (`INotificationMode`) to decouple the `NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling` from specific notification methods. It relies on  often utilizes patterns like the Factory Pattern for object creation.

**1. The Abstraction (Interface):**

Defines the contract that all notification modes must follow.

```csharp
// Interface defining the contract for notification modes
public interface INotificationMode
{
    void Send();
}
```

**2. Concrete Implementations:**

Classes that implement the `INotificationMode` interface.

```csharp
// Concrete implementations of INotificationMode
class EmailService : INotificationMode
{
    public void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Email Sent");
    }
}

class SmsService : INotificationMode
{
    public void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("SMS Sent");
    }
}

class WeirdService : INotificationMode
{
    public void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Weird Notification Sent");
    }
}
```

**3. The Loosely Coupled Service:**

This service depends only on the `INotificationMode` interface, not on any specific implementation. The dependency is injected via the constructor.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// This is an example of Loose Coupling.
/// - The `NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling` class depends on an abstraction (`INotificationMode`) instead of concrete implementations.
/// - This makes the system **easier to maintain and scale**.
/// - The class only knows **what it needs to know** (i.e., `Send()`), adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.
/// </summary>
class NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling
{
    private readonly INotificationMode _notificationMode;

    // Constructor accepts the abstraction (Interface)
    public NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling(INotificationMode notificationMode)
    {
        _notificationMode = notificationMode; // Dependency is injected
    }

    public void Notify()
    {
        _notificationMode.Send(); // Calls the method defined in the interface
    }
}
```

**4. Factory Pattern (Optional but helpful):**

A factory can encapsulate the logic for creating specific `INotificationMode` instances, further decoupling the client code (`Main`) from concrete types.

```csharp
// Enum representing different notification modes
public enum NotificationMode
{
    EMAIL,
    SMS,
    WEIRD
}

/// <summary>
/// Factory Pattern: Creates instances of notification services based on the selected mode.
/// - Helps decouple object creation logic from the main business logic.
/// - Allows easy extension by adding new notification types without changing the factory's clients.
/// </summary>
public class NotificationModeFactory
{
    public static INotificationMode Create(NotificationMode notificationMode)
    {
        switch (notificationMode)
        {
            case NotificationMode.EMAIL:
                return new EmailService();
            case NotificationMode.SMS:
                return new SmsService();
            case NotificationMode.WEIRD:
                return new WeirdService();
            default:
                // Consider throwing an exception for unsupported modes
                // or returning a default/null object pattern implementation.
                Console.WriteLine($"Warning: NotificationMode '{notificationMode}' not recognized. Defaulting to Email.");
                return new EmailService(); 
        }
    }
}
```

**5. Example Usage:**

```csharp
// Example Usage within Main:
/*
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("--- Example of Loose Coupling ---");

    // Use the factory to get the desired implementation
    var serviceMode = NotificationModeFactory.Create(NotificationMode.WEIRD); 

    // Inject the dependency (the specific INotificationMode instance)
    NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling notificationServiceAfterDecoupling =
        new NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling(serviceMode);
        
    notificationServiceAfterDecoupling.Notify(); // Executes WeirdService.Send()

    // Easily switch implementation:
    var emailMode = NotificationModeFactory.Create(NotificationMode.EMAIL);
    var emailNotifier = new NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling(emailMode);
    emailNotifier.Notify(); // Executes EmailService.Send()
}
*/
```

### Pros & Cons of Loose Coupling

#### Pros

    ✅ Easier to maintain, test, and scale. Adding a new `INotificationMode` implementation doesn't require changing `NotificationServiceAfterDecoupling`.

    ✅ Supports [[Dependency Injection]], making unit testing easier (can inject mock implementations of `INotificationMode`).

    ✅ Promotes adherence to principles like [[SOLID Principles|SOLID]], especially [[Single Responsibility Principle|SRP]] and [[Open Closed Principle|OCP]].

    ✅ Increased modularity and reusability of components.

#### Cons
    ❌ Requires extra design effort upfront (defining interfaces, setting up dependency injection or factories).

    ❌ Can introduce more abstractions (interfaces, factories), potentially increasing complexity in very small or simple applications.

    ❌ Navigation through code might sometimes be slightly harder (need to find implementations of an interface).

## Conclusion

While tight coupling might seem quicker initially, **loose coupling** generally leads to more robust, maintainable, testable, and scalable applications, especially as complexity grows. It achieves this by relying on **abstractions (interfaces)** and principles like **Dependency Injection**. Patterns like the **Factory Pattern** can further aid in decoupling object creation logic.
